This example demonstrates a common JavaScript pitfall: the automatic type coercion that can lead to unexpected string concatenation when adding numbers and strings.  The function `foo` intends to add two numbers, but because one input is a string, JavaScript performs string concatenation instead of numeric addition.  The solution shows how to enforce type checking or use a method like `parseInt` or `parseFloat` to ensure proper numeric addition.
